ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Yiyun Zhou (å‘¨é€¸äº‘ in Chinese), a second-year master's student in [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/) <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/zju.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> and advised by Prof. [Jingyuan Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o_G2qa0AAAAJ).


ðŸ”¬ My research has centered on the **data miming, multimodal learning, and LLM**. I have published some papers <a class='all_citation_badges' href="" target="_blank"></a> on the above topics at the top-tier international AI conferences such as WWW2025, KDD2025, ACL2025 and ECML-PKDD2025. Recently, I devote myself to the development of multi-view multi-label	learning.
